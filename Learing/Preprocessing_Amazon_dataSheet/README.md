Data Preprocessing
-> The file amazon.csv, sourced from Kaggle, is used for data preprocessing. Python scripts (Preprocess_1.py and Preprocess_2.py) are employed to extract and clean the desired data, which is then saved in a structured format (Preprocessed_Products_1.txt and Preprocessed_Products_2.txt) for further use.
