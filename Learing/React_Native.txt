To create a **Bare React Native project**, you can use the **React Native CLI** (not Expo). Here's a clean and simple guide:

---

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- **Node.js**
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** – for Android
- **Android Studio** – for emulator
- **Xcode** – for iOS (on macOS only)
- **Watchman** (recommended for macOS)

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

---

### 🛠 Create Bare React Native Project

```bash
npx @react-native-community/cli init MyBareApp
```

> Replace `MyBareApp` with your desired project name.

This creates a **bare-bones React Native project** with native Android and iOS folders.

---

### 🚀 Run the app

#### On Android:

```bash
cd MyBareApp
npx react-native run-android
```

> Make sure your Android emulator or device is running.

#### On iOS (macOS only):

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

> Requires Xcode installed.

---

### 📁 Folder Structure

- `android/` – native Android project
- `ios/` – native iOS project
- `App.js` – entry JavaScript file
- `node_modules/` – installed packages

---

### 🎨 Optional: Use `react-native-paper` for UI

```bash
npm install react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons
```

If you want, I can also give you a **custom starter template** with some pre-styled components, screens, and navigation. Just let me know!
